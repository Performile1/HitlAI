# HitlAI Early Adopter Pricing Strategy

## The Reality

**First 1,000 tests = Training phase**
- AI models are generic (not yet fine-tuned)
- System is learning from your tests
- You're helping us build better AI
- Quality may be lower than future state

**Fair exchange:**
- You pay less
- We get training data
- Everyone wins
